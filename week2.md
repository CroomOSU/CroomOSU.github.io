## Eric Croom’s CS 373 Weekly Write Ups

## Week 2 Write Up
	This week we explored more Advanced Forensics and additional tooling used to investigate a subjects system for information.  The main focus was on understanding what forensics is and how to access the data on a system for investigation without modifying the data.  Additionally, there were several labs to follow along with during the lectures and a challenge provided at the end.

### Forensics
	The discussion revolved around three key aspects of forensics:  Evidence acquisition, Investigation and analysis, and Reporting results.  From the lecture Forensics is “the process of unearthing data of probative value from information systems”.
-	Evidence Acquisition:  Evidence or data obtained from a target system or systems is used to identify facts of the incident and prove or disprove those facts/assumptions.  This data can be wide ranging and obtain from of a variety of sources throughout the target system.
-	Investigation and Analysis:  Once the evidence has been captured the investigation is performed.  Data integrity must be maintained to support any conclusions being drawn from the analysis.  The various tools and processes described over the past 2 weeks of lectures allow for this investigation to take place.
-	Reporting Results:  Throughout the whole process the security analyst must be taking notes on their process and procedures to ensure validity of the process.  If issues arise where data is missing/invalid it must be noted in the report so that the proper authorities are aware of these issues and do not call into question the remaining conclusions.
	The next topic to be discussed revolved around Locard’s Exchange Prinicple and volatility.  This principle states that when objects come in contact with each other material is transferred.  In relation to the topic of forensics this is a good concept to keep in mind as we attempt to gather data on a system while not affecting its contents.
	Interacting with a live system can be delicate as we do not want to lose power.  This can cause volatile resources to be lost and not be recovered in the investigation.  In the evidence acquisition phase, any relevant data that is the most volatile should be collected first before it is lost.  From the lecture the listing below represents volatile sources from most to least.

### Tools and Labs
	Throughout the lectures the labs consisted of demonstrations of new tools and what they are able to do.  Following along I was able to replicate what was demonstrated
