## Eric Croomâ€™s CS 373 Weekly Write Ups


## Week 1 Write Up
This is the first time I've had a class that utilizes outside lecturers for the content and it was very interesting and informative.  I was unaware of the extent of types of malware and some of the tools used for analysis.  This week covered some of the basics describing malware, types, and tools.

### Malware

Malware or Malicious Software is designed to harm or take from the target system.  There is great variety in the types of malware used to employ these attacks.  Attackers can be diverse from governments to scammers with motivation ranging from financial to espionage to just plain destruction.

The Air Force created some terminology to describe attackers - ATP:  Advanced Persistent Threat.  This defines an attacker to be very capable of obtaining an objective while being funded.  An ATP consists of people who perpetrate the activity (actors), for reasons such as money or power (motives), against others (targets).  Generally, the goals are to obtain their targets with methods that prevent detection.

### Types of Malware

Several different types of malware were described in the lectures and resources for the week.
  
  - Viruses:  could be worms, also could be polymorphic in nature, infection by replication
  - Trojans:  infects the host for various purposes, does not replicate
  - Unwanted Programs:  spyware - captures data and usage patterns from the users
  - Ransomware:  Holds the target system hostage for a payout

### Tools

A variety of tools were introduced this week.  I have used various tools from sysinterals before, but not with the intention of detecting and analyzing malware.  Normally, I would use these tools to determine how a process I designed is working and what it should be doing versus what it is doing.  Now I'm using them to determine potential threats and evaluating their methods and ways to stop them.  

The following consists of the tools introduced to help analyze the malware as well as protect the system during infection:

  - Anitspy
  - Process Monitor
  - Process Explorer
  - Fakenet
  - Flypaper
  - FileInsight (not utilized during the lab)
  
### Conclusion

Using the tools and ideas presented in this week's learning module I was able to gain a better understanding of how systems can become infected and the method to which forensic analysis can be applied to learn about these infections for appropriate prevention and sanitization.  There was a lot of information put forth within the 4 hours of discussion and presentation.  I look forward to utilizing these methodologies and toolsets to better understand malware and ways in which to combat it.
