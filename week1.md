## Week 1 Write Up

  This is the first time I've had a class that utilizes outside lecturers for the content and it was very interesting and informative.  I was unaware of the extent of types of malware and some of the tools used for analysis.  This week covered some of the basics describing malware, types, and tools.

### Malware
Malware or Malicoius Software is designed to harm or take from the target system.  There is great variety in the types of malware used to employ these attacks.  Attackers can be diverse from governments to scammers with motivation ranging from financial to espionage to just plain desctruction.

### Types of Malware
Several different types of malware were described in the lectures and resources for the week.
  
  - Viruses:  could be worms, also could be polymorphic in nature, infection by replication
  - Trojans:  infects the host for various purposes, does not replicate
  - Unwanted Programs:  spyware - captures data and usage patterns from the users
  - Ransomware:  Holds the target system hostage for a payout

### Tools
A variety of tools were introduced this week.  I have used various tools from sysinterals before, but not with the intention of detecting and analyzing malware.  Normally, I would use these tools to determine how a process I designed is working and what it should be doing versus what it is doing.  The following consists of the tools introduced to help analyze the malware as well as protect the system during infection:

  - Anitspy
  - Process Monitor
  - Process Explorer
  - Fakenet
  - Flypaper
  - FileInsight (not utilized during the lab)
